# gREST - Graph-based REST API Framework

gREST is a RESTful API development framework on top of Python, Flask, Neo4j and Neomodel. Its primary purpose is to ease development of RESTful APIs with little effort and minimum amount of code. To achieve this, I've made choices to make it easy for developers to construct an API quickly and easily.

Throughout this documentation, I will show you how to develop a simple API and customize it wherever and whenever you want!
