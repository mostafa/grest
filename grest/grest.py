class GRest(FlaskView):
    """
    Base class for graph-based RESTful API development
    :param __model__: create mapping of nodes, relations and endpoints
    :type: dict
    :param __selection_field__: create mapping of selection fields for each node/relation
    :type: dict

    The are two keys to consider:
    __model__:
        primary: model containing source node
        secondary: mapping of endpoints to destination nodes

    For example, you have a User node and Post node.
    User posts a Post, and may like other's posts, so your __model__
    would look like this:
        __model__ = {"primary": User,
                     "secondary": {
                        "posts": Post,
                        "likes": Post
                     }}

    The selection field is the unique field that signifies a specific node
    or its related node(s). It works like the __primary_key__ and __foreign_key__
    property in other ORMs. The above example is completed with the following mapping:
    __selection_field__ = {"primary": "user_id",
                           "secondary": {
                                "posts": "post_id",
                                "likes": "post_id"
                           }}
    """
    __model__ = {"primary": StructuredNode, "secondary": {}}
    __selection_field__ = {"primary": "id", "secondary": {}}
